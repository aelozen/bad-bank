# bad_bank

# Project Description
This is a single page application (SPA) Project developed as part of the MIT xPRO Full-Stack Development Coding Program with the MERN Stack. It's a pretty bad bank, with zero security. You can create an account, deposit, withdraw, and see all data. Standby to watch this bank be transformed into its next best form in my next repository, Good Bank.

# Technology Used
## React & Bootstrap all the way!

# Features
This banking application as mentioned is pretty bad, but it still has some pretty key features like password, email, and login authentication. It lets you know when you are successful and when your transaction has failed.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
